Home Assistant custom integration for MEA (Metropolitan Electricity Authority) electricity tariffs.

This integration provides:
- A `sensor` for the current MEA Time-of-Use state (`off-peak` / `on-peak`).
- Price sensors for MEA base tariff blocks (units 1–15 through 401+).
- Time-of-Use (TOU) tariff sensors for 12–24 kV and under 12 kV.
- FT (Fuel Tariff) price sensor.
- A `button` to force-refresh all tariff data on demand.
- Monthly refresh of tariff prices and annual refresh of the holiday schedule.
- Device grouping so all MEA tariff entities belong to the same device.

## Features

- Parses MEA tariff pages from:
  - `https://www.mea.or.th/electricity/electricity-tariffs/B0kv94Yol` — holiday schedule.
  - `https://www.mea.or.th/our-services/tariff-calculation/other/D5xEaEwgU` — base and TOU tariff prices.
  - `https://www.mea.or.th/our-services/tariff-calculation/ft/bG2m6iSUN` — FT rate history.
- Supports config entry setup through the Home Assistant UI.
- Persists tariff prices and holidays in Home Assistant storage so they survive restarts.

## Time-of-Use Schedule

| Period | Days | Hours |
|--------|------|-------|
| On-peak | Mon – Fri (excluding public holidays) | 09:00 – 22:00 |
| Off-peak | Mon – Fri (excluding public holidays) | 22:00 – 09:00 |
| Off-peak | Sat – Sun and public holidays | All day |

## Entities

The integration exposes the following entities (all grouped under one device):

## Installation

### HACS (Custom Repository)

1. Add this repository as a custom integration in HACS.
2. Install the integration from HACS.
3. Restart Home Assistant.
4. Go to **Settings → Devices & Services → Add Integration**.
5. Search for `MEA Electricity Tariffs` and follow the setup flow.

### Manual Installation
